                <h3>Introduction</h3>
                <p>Spotify-curated playlists are followed by millions of Spotify users. These playlists are created by
                    a combination of algorithmic and human-driven processes. Spotify playlists are both personalized
                    (e.g., Discover Weekly) as well as intended for general browsing based on genres, moods, or
                    current events.
                </p>

                <p>
                    This capstone project aims to answer the following question: to what extent can we predict the success
                    of a Spotify-curated playlist, based only on the songs that comprise that playlist? Do the intrinsic
                    features of a song, from it acoustic properties to its relative position within a playlist, contribute
                    to how well users will respond to that overall playlist?<br>

                <h3>Data Source</h3>
                <p> The primary source used for data in this project was the publicly available <strong>Spotify Api</strong>.
                 From the API, we obtained valuable information about playlists, from their lengths and popularities to
                their component songs and a list of Spotify-derived audio features for each track. For this project we
                analyzed <strong>2,000 playlists</strong> that have been individually curated by Spotify, encompassing a universe of roughly
                <strong>20,000 songs</strong>.</p>

                <h3>Project Features</h3>
                <p>
                    Our project is divided into the following broad spheres of analysis:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Deciding on a suitable metric for popularity</li>
                    <li>Developing a per-song training set of features from the Spotify API to predict the popularity of
                    any given playlist (or collection of tracks)</li>
                    <li>Deriving our own audio features using sophisticated signal processing and feature extractinon techniques</li>
                    <li>Using Spotify's and our own features to generate similarity metrics that can optimize the creation
                    of a new, optimal playlist given an input song of interest</li>

                </ul>

            defined as the number of playlist followers binned into 5 popularity levels based on quantile. The

            component songs. As the number of songs per playlist varies, summary metrics were decided upon and tested
            in order to generate a final array of playlist-level features that could be used for a suitable prediction.</p></center>

                  <h3>Subset 1: Song-Level Data</h3>
                  <p>The Spotify API provides a number of important data points on the track level, namely the popularity of
                  the track on an index basis from 1 to 100, as well as the number of markets the song is available in. The API
                  also notably includes the following audio-based features per song: acousticness, danceability, duration,
                  energy, instrumentalness, key, liveness, loudness, mode, tempo, valence, and time signature. One measure per
                  audio feature is provided per song, and is intended to be interpreted as a relative "level" at which the feature
                  gravitates throughout a given song.</p>

                  <h3>Subset 2: Playlist-Level Data</h3>

                  <p>Playlist-level data includes three primary metrics: the number of followers (in other words, the value
                  we are trying to predict), the number of tracks that are in the playlist, and indicator of whether the
                  playlist is featured or not.</p>

                  <p>Various models were tested for this task, including logistic regression, support vector machines,
                  and random forest classifiers. The best performing model was a random forest whose overall accuracy was
                  78% on a training set.</p>

                  <h3>Generating a Training Set</h3>
                  <p>
                      One important observation that guided our modeling approach for playlist popularity prediction
                      was the understanding that the mean popularity of a playlist's tracks were a rough proxy or
                      independently strong predictor of popularity. In order to improve upon the predictive ability of an
                      all-encompassing model, however, our goal was to determine whether the addition of acoustical
                      features to a training set would improve the classification rate of a predictive model.<br>
                  </p>
                  <center><img style="width: 80%; display: block" src="images/sketch1.png"/></center>
                  <p>
                      <br>In order to generate a training set of playlist-level features, a careful consideration of track-level
                      analysis had to be made in order to aggregate song data in a meaningful way. While simple averaging or
                      addition could have been a simple solution, capturing the distribution of acoustic features more
                      precisely hypothetically contains better predictive ability. As a result, our approach was to first
                      approximate the distribution of acoustic features by representing each acoustic features in 5 different
                      columns, each corresponding to the quantile of that feature's distribution across the playlist. The
                      second, and chosen, approach was to instead reflect the distribution through sequencing, by providing
                      the median value of that acoustic feature for songs that belong to a particular quartile of the
                      playlist's progression.
