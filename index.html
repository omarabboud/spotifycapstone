                <h3>Introduction</h3>
                <p>Spotify-curated playlists are followed by millions of Spotify users. These playlists are created by
                    a combination of algorithmic and human-driven processes. Spotify playlists are both personalized
                    (e.g., Discover Weekly) as well as intended for general browsing based on genres, moods, or
                    current events.
                </p>

                <p>
                    This capstone project aims to answer the following question: to what extent can we predict the success
                    of a Spotify-curated playlist, based only on the songs that comprise that playlist? Do the intrinsic
                    features of a song, from it acoustic properties to its relative position within a playlist, contribute
                    to how well users will respond to that overall playlist?<br>

                <h3>Data Source</h3>
                <p> The primary source used for data in this project was the publicly available <strong>Spotify Api</strong>.
                 From the API, we obtained valuable information about playlists, from their lengths and popularities to
                their component songs and a list of Spotify-derived audio features for each track. For this project we
                analyzed <strong>2,000 playlists</strong> that have been individually curated by Spotify, encompassing a universe of roughly
                <strong>20,000 songs</strong>.</p>

                <h3>Project Features</h3>
                <p>
                    Our project is divided into the following broad spheres of analysis:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Deciding on a suitable metric for popularity</li>
                    <li>Developing a per-song training set of features from the Spotify API to predict the popularity of
                    any given playlist (or collection of tracks)</li>
                    <li>Deriving our own audio features using sophisticated signal processing and feature extractinon techniques</li>
                    <li>Using Spotify's and our own features to generate similarity metrics that can optimize the creation
                    of a new, optimal playlist given an input song of interest</li>

            <center><p class='collabbox'>This section describes a series of models that predict the popularity of a playlist,
            defined as the number of playlist followers binned into 5 popularity levels based on quantile. The

            component songs. As the number of songs per playlist varies, summary metrics were decided upon and tested
            in order to generate a final array of playlist-level features that could be used for a suitable prediction.</p></center>

                  <h3>Subset 1: Song-Level Data</h3>
                  <p>The Spotify API provides a number of important data points on the track level, namely the popularity of
                  the track on an index basis from 1 to 100, as well as the number of markets the song is available in. The API
                  also notably includes the following audio-based features per song: acousticness, danceability, duration,
                  energy, instrumentalness, key, liveness, loudness, mode, tempo, valence, and time signature. One measure per
                  audio feature is provided per song, and is intended to be interpreted as a relative "level" at which the feature
                  gravitates throughout a given song.</p>

                  <h3>Subset 2: Playlist-Level Data</h3>

                  <p>Playlist-level data includes three primary metrics: the number of followers (in other words, the value
                  we are trying to predict), the number of tracks that are in the playlist, and indicator of whether the
                  playlist is featured or not.</p>

                  <p>Various models were tested for this task, including logistic regression, support vector machines,
                  and random forest classifiers. The best performing model was a random forest whose overall accuracy was
                  78% on a training set.</p>

                  <h3>Generating a Training Set</h3>
                  <p>
                      One important observation that guided our modeling approach for playlist popularity prediction
                      was the understanding that the mean popularity of a playlist's tracks were a rough proxy or
                      independently strong predictor of popularity. In order to improve upon the predictive ability of an
                      all-encompassing model, however, our goal was to determine whether the addition of acoustical
                      features to a training set would improve the classification rate of a predictive model.<br>
                  </p>
                  <center><img style="width: 80%; display: block" src="images/sketch1.png"/></center>
                  <p>
                      <br>In order to generate a training set of playlist-level features, a careful consideration of track-level
                      analysis had to be made in order to aggregate song data in a meaningful way. While simple averaging or
                      addition could have been a simple solution, capturing the distribution of acoustic features more
                      precisely hypothetically contains better predictive ability. As a result, our approach was to first
                      approximate the distribution of acoustic features by representing each acoustic features in 5 different
                      columns, each corresponding to the quantile of that feature's distribution across the playlist. The
                      second, and chosen, approach was to instead reflect the distribution through sequencing, by providing
                      the median value of that acoustic feature for songs that belong to a particular quartile of the
                      playlist's progression.

                    The acoustic features include 13 Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients(MFCC) , 12 Chroma coefficients in addition to energy and other spectral features.
                    These features are a characteristic of the frequency and pitch of the songs. Combining all the 34 features taken at 30 timestamps of a song make 1020

            <h3>Predicting track popularity</h3>
            <p>This section describes modelling techniques used to predict the popularity of a track given the raw-audio features.</p>
            The predictors are the mean value of the individual raw-audio features extracted at 30 timestamps and the response is the track popularity
                (in range 0-100)  available from spotify api. Dimensionality reduction techniques like PCA did not give improvement in model performance
                so, we decided to take the mean value of each feature.
                <ol>
                <li><strong>Regression Model </strong>Regression models like linear regression , GAMs(Generalized additive models) and Random Forest Regressors
                were implemented and the best model was Random Forest Regression with R2 = 0.35. Since the regression models do not perform well, we changed the
                problem to a classification problem by binning the response variable in 6 bins. The songs of low popularity (0-50) were put in bin 1, bin 2
                contains songs of popularity 50-60 and so on.
                    <li><strong>Classification Model </strong>
                    Random Forest Classification Model turned out to be the best classifier out of different classifiers with cross-validation classification accuracy
                    of 76%. More importantly, the class of the most popular songs has F-score=1(precision =1, recall =1) ,i.e., the most popular class has zero
                    misclassification rate.  The dataset was skewed, with a lot more low popularity songs compared to high popularity songs. Class weights were used to tackle
                    imbalanced dataset.

            <h2 class="sectiontitle">Acoustic Similarity</h2>
            The traditional approach technique of determining acoustic similarity is by hand. But this is infeasible for
            large quantities of music. Some researchers have tried to analyize MIDI music data to find melody contour for each
            part of music. But the type of music similarity required for playlist construction is based on the overall sound of 
            music rather than just the melody. One of such approaches is to use the indexing based on matching features such as
            Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients(MFCCs), Chroma coefficients and energy etc. For this project, we used the following 
            two metrics to get acoustically similar songs.

                     <strong>Obtaining the spectral signature</strong>
                    
                    <p>The spectral signature attempts to capture the main statistics of the freqeuncy and chroma coefficients
                    to characterize the main types of sounds present in a track. We achieve this by dividing each song into 
                    30 frames each of 1 second.
                    <ol><li>For each frame, we obtain a spectral representation which consists of 13 MFCCs,
                    12 Chroma coefficents in addition to other spectral and energy features.
                    <li>Once we have these frames, we use Gaussian Mixture Models based clustering to cluster them into 4 clusters for each song. 
                    <p>It is important to note that the clustering is local to each song.
                    The clusters are characterized by means, covariances and weights( weight is proportional to the no. of frames
                    present in each cluster). The set of clusters define the signature of a song. </p>

                    <strong>Finding song similarity </strong>
                    <p>Once we have the spectral signature of two songs, we use EMD to calculate the similarity between songs.
                    EMD is defined as the amount of probability mass required to move from one signature to another.
                    We use symmetric form of KL divergence to calculate the distance between two clusters. Linear programming
                    is used to minimize the cost (defined by multiplying flow with KL divergence distance). Finally EMD is calculated
                    as weighted sum of distances between clusters where weights are flow(probability mass). The lower the EMD value,
                    the more the similarity between songs.                    
                    
                    
                    <p><strong>Optimize song search </strong></p>
                    <p>We have a database of around 15000 songs with their spectral signature. Given a track, its computationally expensive
                    to calculate its EMD from the entire database of songs. To optimize the search process, we use vantange points
                    method. The database of songs is clustered into 10 clusters using Kmeans clustering and the cluster centres are
                    chosen as vantange points. Given an input track, we find the closest vantange point and then return top 200  acoustically
                    similar songs from that cluster (where acoustic similarity is calculated using EMD).
                    This reduces the computation of EMD to a subset of songs.</p>
                <h3>Manhattan Distance</h3>
                Calculating EMD between two songs a computationally expensive. In addition to that, raw-audio is required to 
                get the spectral signature. To deal with computational complexity, we used Manhattan distance to calculate song similarity.
                Instead of using raw-audio features, we used acoustic features provided by spotify api as a feature set for the song.
                We used this distance metric to get a list fo acoustically similar songs  from related artists.

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Step 1: </strong>
                    From a seed track, find related tracks to be candidates for the final output playlist. These candidate tracks fall into three different categories of tracks:
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Top tracks from Spotify-defined related artists</strong></li>
                            <li><strong>Tracks from related artists identified as acoustically similar</strong> to the seed song. Acoustic similarity is found using the manhattan distance and Spotify API features.</li>
                            <li><strong>Tracks from a separate database of tracks identified as acoustically similar</strong> to the seed song. Acoustic similarity is found using vantage points and Earth mover's distance.</li>

                        </ol>
                    <li><strong>Step 2: </strong>
                    Select candidate songs from one or more of the above categories. Categories can be weighted to include different proportions of songs from each category.
                </li>
                    <li><strong>Step 3: </strong>
                    Randomly sample 30 tracks from the candidate tracks and optimize the number of playlist followers using our predictive model and simulated annealing. The loss function is defined as a weighted average between class 4 and 5 probabilities--i.e., the playlist has a high probability of falling into the top two quantiles for number of followers. Run four optimizations in parallel and select the best result.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Step 4: </strong>
                    Output a final playlist that is predicted to be most successful.
                    </li>
                </ul>

              <h3>Conclusions</h3>

              <p>What this Capstone has concluded is that combinations of songs can be optimized for popularity using
                  a simulated annealing method supported by raw audio-based similarity metrics and a Random Forest
                  predictive model of popularity. Analyzing the intrinsic data of a song — especially its acoustical
                  features — as well as its placement alongside other songs, can result in a reliable prediction of
                  popularity on a scale of 1 to 5. This is a particularly important technical and strategic finding
                  for Spotify; as the company grows, modelling techniques such as these have the potential to make
                  their playlists and other product offerings more data-driven, rigorous, and scaleable.

                <h3>Future Work</h3>
                <p>
                    We recommend two areas of future research: first, steps must be taken to mitigate the rare case
                    of overfitting that affected our random forest classifier, which over-predicted unpopular playlists
                    in the testing set. Second, more metadata must be collected and then incorporated as predictors of
                    popularity to ensure that acoustical features are not capturing information such as release date or
                    other non-intrinsic characteristics.
